## Introduction

### Project Overview
 The goal here is to harness the power of machine learning to understand and forecast how different factors influence students' academic outcomes. By diving into various aspects of students' lives and their educational environment, we aim to build a model that can predict their final grades with accuracy.

### Purpose
We’re tackling a pressing question: What really impacts student performance? By analyzing data on everything from family background to study habits, we’re looking to uncover insights that could help educators and schools provide better support to students. Our hope is that these insights will lead to improved strategies for enhancing academic success.

### Description
This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks.
